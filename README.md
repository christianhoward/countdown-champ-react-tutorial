# countdown-champ
This is my countdown timer following [David Katz](http://davidtkatz.com/#/about)'s ReactJS and Redux - Mastering Web Apps Course on Udemy. This repo is used purely for learning exercises and the course content should not be interpreted as something I've created on my own.

The timer counts down from the specified deadline. Currently, it is set to countdown to December 25, 2017, but can be updated using the form input. Setting a new deadline updates the deadline state to the new deadline.
